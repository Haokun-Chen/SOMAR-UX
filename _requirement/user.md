- SOMAR users are **oceanographers and environmental fluid mechanic practitioners** who are interested in describing the flow of stratified flows in geophysical conditions (e.g, in high aspect ratio domains and where stratification dominates the physics). SOMAR has been used to study, among other problems, the evolution of an idealized version of the southern ocean (the ocean around the Antarctic continent) under different scenarios of wind and buoyancy forcing, the evolution of density fronts subject to the effect of rotation, the generation of internal waves by tidal flow over localizedtopography, and the evolution of internal waves under shoaling bottom conditions. 

- In all these cases, the users had to set up the geometry of the problem, and provide relevant initial and boundary conditions. They also had to monitor the output, and calculate relevant diagnostic quantities from the output.
