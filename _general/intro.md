The Stratified Ocean Model with Adaptive Refinement (SOMAR) is a free software provided jointly by the Marine Sciences and Physics departments of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. This project focuses on building a Python interface and potentially with a post-processing Python script, which connect to the computing backend to enable users to configure initial parameters and launch SOMAR from Python interface.
